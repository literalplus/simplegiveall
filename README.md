Simple Giveall
=============

A very simple Bukkit plugin that gives all online players one or more item(s).

Commands
---------
Currently, there is only one command: <br>
__/giveall__: _Gives all online players a specified item stack._<br>
  Aliases: _xyga, ga_<br>
  Usage 1: __/giveall hand &lt;amount&gt;__ Gives all online players the item in your hand, with specified amount.<br>
  Usage 2: __/giveall &lt;ITEM_NAME&gt; &lt;amount&gt;__ Gives all online players an item by name (see Bukkit's Material) and amount. <br>
  Usage 3: __/giveall &lt;item id&gt; &lt;amount&gt;__ Gives all online players an item by id (do not rely on this, may be removed in future _Minecraft_ releases) and amount. <br>

Permissions
------------
Well, this one is quite simple, too.<br>
*xy.giveall.use*: Allows to use /giveall and also see who executed it instead of just what has been given.<br>
